Dartium is a special build of Chromium that includes the Dart VM.
Using Dartium means you don't have to compile your code to JavaScript
until you're ready to test on other browsers.

<h2 id="install"> Installing Dartium </h2>

<p>
  You donâ€™t usually need to do anything special to install Dartium:
  just unarchive the ZIP file.
  If you want Dart Editor to launch a particular copy of Dartium,
  then put that copy inside the <code>dart-sdk</code> directory
  of your Dart Editor installation directory,
  replacing its original copy of Chromium.
