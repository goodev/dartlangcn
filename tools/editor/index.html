<p>
  Unzip the file you downloaded. You're done!
</p>

<p>
  Want to use command-line tools, as well?
  You already have them, thanks to the Dart download including the SDK.
  However, you might want to set environment variables,
  as described in the <a href="/tools/sdk/">SDK page</a>.
</p>

<p>
The default version of Dart Editor
is the <em>stable build</em>.
It's automatically updated about once every six weeks.
The
<a target="_blank"
  href="{{ site.custom.downloads.dartarchive-stable-url-prefix }}/latest/changelog.html">change log</a>
has a list of release dates and features.
The <em>dev channel build</em>, on the other hand, is the
latest tested version of the Dart Editor which contains the newest features but may still contain some bugs.
If you use the dev channel build, please get new builds frequently,
and send feedback about new features and bugs that you encounter.

<h2 id="build"> Customizing the build </h2>

<p>
  You can add behavior to the Dart Editor build process
  by creating a build.dart file.
  For example,
  Web UI uses a build.dart file to run custom tools over Dart and HTML files
  and to map from the original files to the generated files.
  See <a href="build.html">Build.dart and the Dart Editor Build System</a>
  for details on implementing your own build.dart file.
</p>

  (at the upper right of the Dart Editor window)
  whenever you notice a problem
